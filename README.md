## Hi there 👋

# ⚡ Glitch Labs  

Welcome to **Glitch Labs** — where experiments, side projects, and out-of-the-box ideas come to life 🚀. This is my digital sandbox for trying out new frameworks, APIs, algorithms, and full-stack concepts.

## 🧪 What is Glitch Labs?

A creative space where I:

- Prototype unconventional tech ideas 🤯  
- Build experimental tools and micro-apps ⚙️  
- Test out new frontend & backend frameworks 💻  
- Explore AI/ML hacks & data experiments 📊  
- Tinker with APIs, real-time systems, and cloud services ☁️  

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists  

I believe some of the coolest ideas are born out of curiosity projects that glitch, break, and evolve. **Glitch Labs** is my collection of those ideas before they make it to the big stage.  

It’s where I:

- Break things on purpose 🔧  
- Rebuild them smarter 🔥  
- Learn faster 💡  
- Share what works (and what doesn’t) 📖
